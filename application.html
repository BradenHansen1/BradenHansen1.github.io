        <h2>How Cookie Clicker Works</h2>
        <p>Cookie Clicker is a fun and addictive incremental game where the goal is to bake as many cookies as possible. Here's how it works:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click on the big cookie to bake cookies.</li>
            <li>Use the cookies you bake to buy upgrades and buildings that automatically produce more cookies.</li>
            <li>Keep clicking and upgrading to increase your cookie production rate.</li>
            <li>Watch your cookie count grow exponentially as you progress!</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>Cookie Clicker is one of, if not the most addicting games of the early 2010's</h2>
        <p>Personally I found the one off cool math games the most addicting:)</p>
        <p>I apologize since this was not great. I am currently heading to grand junction and don't have a lot of time to get into the nitty gritty of the css code and to make things look pretty</p>
