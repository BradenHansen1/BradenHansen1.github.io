        <h2>How Cookie Clicker Works</h2>
        <p>Cookie Clicker is a fun and addictive incremental game where the goal is to bake as many cookies as possible. Here's how it works:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Click on the big cookie to bake cookies.</li>
            <li>Use the cookies you bake to buy upgrades and buildings that automatically produce more cookies.</li>
            <li>Keep clicking and upgrading to increase your cookie production rate.</li>
            <li>Watch your cookie count grow exponentially as you progress!</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Cookie Clicker is one of, if not the most addicting games of the early 2010's</p>
