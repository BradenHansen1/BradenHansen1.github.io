        <h1>Stuff that humors me</h1>
        <h2>Youtube</h2>
        <p>Youtube is basically my tv platform</p>
        <a href="https://www.youtube.com/">Youtube Homepage</a>

        <h2>Instagram</h2>
        <p>Since I lost Tiktok I now am on Instagram.</p>
        <a href="https://www.instagram.com/">r/Click Here</a>

        <h2>Netflix</h2>
        <p>Netflix is my second go to for streaming because It's super easy to use and the UI is easy on the eyes compared to something like Hulu</p>
